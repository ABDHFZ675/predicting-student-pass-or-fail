# 🧠 Student Performance Prediction using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Title:
**Student Performance Prediction**

## 📚 Objective:
To build a simple machine learning model using **Logistic Regression** that predicts whether a student will **pass or fail** based on:
- 📘 Hours Studied
- 📈 Attendance Percentage

---

## 📁 Dataset:
The dataset was manually created with the following columns:

| Hours_Studied | Attendance (%) | Pass/Fail |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| 5             | 85             | 1         |
| 2             | 60             | 0         |
| 4             | 75             | 1         |
| ...           | ...            | ...       |

- **Pass = 1**, **Fail = 0**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries:
- Python (Google Colab)
- `pandas` – for data handling
- `matplotlib` – for data visualization
- `sklearn` – for machine learning (Logistic Regression)

---

## 🧪 Steps Involved:
1. Manually create a small dataset
2. Load and display data using `pandas`
3. Visualize data using `matplotlib`
4. Split dataset into training and testing sets
5. Train a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluate prediction accuracy
7. Test the model on new sample inputs

---

## 🎯 Output Summary:

- ✅ **Accuracy**: ~100% (may vary due to small sample size)
- ✅ **Prediction Example**:

| Hours_Studied | Attendance | Predicted_Result |
|---------------|------------|------------------|
| 3.0           | 70         | Pass (1)         |
| 1.5           | 45         | Fail (0)         |
| 5.5           | 95         | Pass (1)         |
